## Requirements

### iOS

Latest XCode installed

### NodeJS

You will need latest version of NodeJS installed. We recommend [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for easier management of NodeJS versions:

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

or

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash


After that you need to enable it (You can add this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` For automatic inintialization after opening your command line):

    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

After `nvm` is available in your command line, you can easily install and switch between NodeJS versions, examples:

    nvm install 10     # installs NodeJS version 10
    nvm use 9          # switches to NodeJS version 9

# Installation

    git clone https://github.com/carera/rn-workshop-mdevcamp2018.git
    cd rn-workshop-mdevcamp2018
    npm install

# Running

    cd rn-workshop-mdevcamp2018
    npm start           # runs the javascript packager for development purposes

Open `rn-workshop-mdevcamp2018/ios/RNmDevCamp2018.xcodeproj` in your XCode and press `Build and Run`
